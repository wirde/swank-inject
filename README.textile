h1. Injecting a Clojure REPL in an unmodified application 

h2. Building

lein uberjar

h2. Usage

Start application in remote debug mode using JVM switches:
-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=7777,server=y,suspend=n 

Start injector:
java -cp swank-inject-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar com.wirde.inject.Main -host localhost -port 7777 -url [URL to the standalone jar] -instances [qualified class name of a (singleton) instance]

Run Emacs (with swank-clojure installed)

h2. TODO

* Error handling
* Handle singletons being loaded in multiple classloaders. How to select which leg to follow?
* Ability to inject "ordinary" remote shell, and not just swank-clojure
