h1. Injecting a Clojure REPL in an unmodified application 

"It's a hack, but it (kind of) works..."

A tool which lets you "inject" a Clojure REPL into a running Java application with remote debugging enabled. You are also able to specify one or more classes, one instance of each of those classes (preferably singletons) will be bound to the symbol  @swank-inject.aot/*ctx*@.

Uses Java Debug Interface (JDI) and a URLClassLoader to inject the code (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/jdk/api/jpda/jdi/index.html)

h2. Building

Built with https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
> lein uberjar

h2. Sample Usage

Show options:
> java -cp swank-inject-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar com.wirde.inject.Main -h
Remote Swank injector.Options
  --host <arg>       The hostname of the (remote) process                           
  --port <arg>       The portnumber of the process with remote debugging enabled    
  --urls <arg>       Comma separated list of URLs to jar-files used while injecting 
  --instances <arg>  Comma separated list of classes to locate instances for        
  --injectee <arg>   Injectee class (default com.wirde.inject.ReplInjectee)

Start application in remote debug mode using JVM switches:
-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=7777,server=y,suspend=n 

Start injector:
> java -cp swank-inject-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar com.wirde.inject.Main -host localhost -port 7777 -urls file:///home/wirde/swank-inject-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar -instances com.wirde.MySingleton

Connect to the REPL using telnet (port 4711)

Your instances will be available in a sequence bound to @swank-inject.aot/*ctx*@

h2. Injecting a Swank server

At the moment injecting a Swank repl does not work completely (the injecting process never exits). To try it out anyway, use the following option:
-injectee com.wirde.inject.SwankInjectee

h2. Injecting other code

By providing an implementation of com.wirde.inject.Injectee using the "-injectee" option (must be available in one of the jars pointed to by -urls) you can inject arbitrary code.

h2. Limitations

* Probably only works for HotSpot...
* Expects classes passed to be singletons, if not then the first found instance will be used.
* Will currently not work reliably if the class is loaded in multiple classloaders.
* Using Swank as the injected REPL does not work well for some reason. For now I am using clojure.contrib.server-socket/create-repl-server as the default.

h2. TODO

* Handle singletons being loaded in multiple classloaders. How to select which branch to follow?
* Alternatively start a Swank REPL
